This is the link to our [processed navigation data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pbojewluy0tz95jsmtfd5/processed-navigation-data.zip?rlkey=186anxv8wzj13im3eadpnonzo&dl=0).

### File Structure:
```
processed navigation data
|-- subject (s02): each participant
| |-- behavioral data
| | |-- run number: direction information for each experiment
| |
| |-- imagingData_processed: processed into nifti format
| | |-- run number: imaging data for each experiment
| | | |-- xxx01.nii: 3D brain image for each sampling time (1.5s)
| |
| |-- imagingData_tifffile: processed into .tif format
| | |-- runnumber.tif: each file is a 4D array of (Time, X, Y, Z),
| | | each XYZ is the Entorhinal cortex after masking, with a sampling interval of 1.5s
| |
| |-- LEC.nii: Left Entorhinal cortex mask
| |-- rLEC.nii: Left Entorhinal cortex mask resliced to the same resolution as the images
|
|-- s03
